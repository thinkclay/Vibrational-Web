		<h1>Vibrational Profile</h1>
		<p>
			Using the Emotional-Vibrational Color Scale &trade; we evaluate the way you think and feel
			on generic topics and life subject to then assign you a color. These colors show you the amount
			and types of colors you give off (you've heard of Aura's right?) and then help you follow,
			change, attract, and interact with your own internal vibrations as well as the people around you.
