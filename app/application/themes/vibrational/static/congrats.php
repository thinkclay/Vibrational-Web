	<h3>Congratulations!</h3>
	<h4>You have made the first choice to consciously shifting your vibrations… daily.</h4>
	<p>
	Now that you've identified your choices and vibrations, in the future the fastest and easiest way to shift your thoughts and feelings up the EVCS is to "appreciate." The choice to appreciate adds value to any situation with positive vibrations—instantly. You can actually feel this shift UP in vibration on the EVCS because appreciation is the vibration of feeling favorable toward or thankful about something or someone. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, choosing to feel appreciation about some small aspect of that situation will bring "relief"—a higher vibration. <strong>Try it!</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	You can start right now by practicing appreciating anything during the day, and you will feel yourself move higher up on the EVCS. Three more easy ways to make a positive shift UP the EVCS are to do a simple choice of kindness, donate resources to your favorite organization(s)—or give back by volunteering. <strong>Notice the high vibrations that you feel when you do!</strong>
